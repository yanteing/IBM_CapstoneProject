# IBM_CapstoneProject

In this project we will assume that we have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm. My role centers on analyzing data to forecast future skill requirements, keeping us competitive amid evolving technologies.

My primary task involves gathering data from diverse sources—such as job postings, training portals, and surveys—to compile a comprehensive list of the most sought-after programming skills. Once I've amassed sufficient data, the next phase involves scrutinizing this information to uncover trends and insights for this year's report on emerging skills. Then, I'll consolidate all the information by utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics to craft the dashboard. Lastly, I'll leverage my storytelling skills to present my findings in a compelling presentation

Each stage of this data analysis process is detailed in separate notebooks within the repository, complemented by additional files for clarity and context.
